                          <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

                      <section>
                          <h2>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

                          <h3>Insufficient contrast ratio</h3>

                          <p>Blue branding used for text and the border colour across the site don’t meet contrast ratio requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) and 1.4.11 Non-text contrast.</p>
                      
                          <h3>All parts of website should be keyboard accessible</h3>

                          <p>The main menu on the website is inaccessible to keyboard only users. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.1.1 Keyboard.</p>

                          <h3>Pages are not titled correctly</h3>

                          <p>When users navigate to different pages the titles are not updated and could confuse users of assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.4.2 Page titled.</p>
                      
                          <h3>Focus styling should be visible</h3>

                          <p>The focus styling used across the site is not visible and does not meet contrast requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.4.7 Focus visible.</p>

                          <h3>Focus order</h3>

                          <p>On the homepage there are panels that function as links but are not marked up as such so will be skipped in the focus order of the page. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.4.3 Focus order.</p>

                          <h3>Dynamically changing content should be announced</h3>

                          <p>Content across the site that is dynamically changed and modal boxes are not announced to screen reader users. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 4.1.3 Status messages.</p>

                          <h3>Descriptive headings and labels</h3>

                          <p>Labels used in forms are not descriptive enough and don’t provide enough context to the requirement. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.4.6 Headings and labels.</p>

                          <h3>Responsive content</h3>

                          <p>When viewing tables on the history page the content does not reflow and remains hidden on smaller devices. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 1.4.10 Reflow.</p>

                          <h3>Links should make sense when read out of context</h3>

                          <p>Pagination links used across the site when read out of context don’t make sense. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 2.4.4 Link purpose.</p>

                          <h3>Accessible iframes</h3>

                          <p>Iframes across the site have no title attribute so the content they contain will not be announced to screen reader users. This fails WCAG 2.1 criteria 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.</p>

                              <li>To be able to navigate the website using speech recognition software</li>
                              <li>To increase the contrast ratio of all text within the website to a minimum of 4.5:1</li>
                              <li>Ensure that the title of the webpage changes when each area of the website is accessed</li>
                              <li>Add context to the label descriptions within all forms</li>
                              <li>Ensure all forms are easy to read when viewing the website by a mobile device</li>
                              <li>Add descriptive title attributes to all iframes on the website</li>
                              <li>Ensure all input field borders meet the requirement of 3:1</li>
                              <li>Add ID attribute to input fields on forms and for attribute to the label fields</li>
                              <li>Add attributes to the website to announce to those accessing app.myhelm.org using a screen reader when a change is made e.g. completion of searches</li>
